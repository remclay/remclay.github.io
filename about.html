<p>From Queensland, Australia, I studied Law and Biomedical Science on the beautiful Gold Coast. Following an 18 month hiatus spent working and travelling in USA and Central America, I headed to Sydney, Australia to practice commercial law. After a few action pack years in the courtroom, I found myself in search of a career in a more dynamic industry. Promising constant challenges and continued learning, a career in web development ticked all the boxed. So here I am - making the switch!</p>
